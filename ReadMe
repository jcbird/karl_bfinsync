Abstract:
    I present a catalog of point-source objects toward NGC 1333, resolving
    a wide variety of confusion about source names (and occasionally
    positions) in the literature. I incorporate data from optical to radio
    wavelengths, but focus most of the effort on being complete and
    accurate from J (1.25{mu}m) to 24{mu}m. The catalog encompasses
    52^{deg}^<R.A.<52.5{deg} and 31{deg}<decl.<31.6{deg}.
    Cross-identifications include those from more than 25 papers and
    catalogs from 1994 to 2014, primarily those in wide use as origins of
    nomenclature. Gaps in our knowledge are identified, with the most
    important being a lack of spectroscopy for spectral types or even
    confirmation of youth and/or cluster membership. I fit a slope to the
    spectral energy distribution (SED) between 2 and 24{mu}m for the
    members (and candidate members) to obtain an SED classification, and I
    compare the resulting classes to those for the same sources in the
    literature, and for an SED fit between 2 and 8{mu}m. While there are
    certainly differences, for the majority of the sources, there is good
    agreement.

Description:
    I present a catalog of point-source objects toward NGC 1333. I
    incorporated data from optical to radio wavelengths, but focused most
    of my effort on J (1.25{mu}m) to 24{mu}m. Cross-identifications
    include those from more than 25 papers and catalogs from 1994 to 2015
    (see Table 1). In the process of assembling the literature catalog of
    sources, I reconciled many ambiguities and inconsistencies in the
    literature. All of the reconciled cross-identifications in NGC 1333
    are included in Table2, including an indication of whether or not the
    corresponding survey identified the object as a Young Stellar Object
    (YSO).

    All of the aggregate J-[24] single-epoch photometry appears in Table3.
    There are nearly 7000 objects in the catalog, about 300 of which are
    identified in the literature as YSO candidates.

Note (2): If YSO candidate. In the spirit of Wilking et al.
     (2001ApJ...551..357W), I define the NIR to MIR (2-24{mu}m) slope of the
     SED, {alpha}=d(log{lambda}F_{lambda}_)/d(log{lambda}).
Note (3): Our SED classification scheme is defined as:
 I    = YSO candidate with {alpha}>0.3;
 flat = YSO candidate with -0.3<{alpha}<0.3 (flat spectrum)
 II   = YSO candidate with -1.6<{alpha}< -0.3;
 III  = YSO candidate with {alpha}< -1.6.
 notY = not an YSO candidate
 Note that there are 25 objects with insufficient points in the Spectral
 Energy Distribution (SED), such that I cannot assign a class.
Note (4): Table6 has the numbers of objects in my catalog for which my classes
     match (or do not match) the classes obtained from this other approach.
Note (5): Arnold et al. (2012ApJS..201...12A) have different classes than I
     have defined:
 FS  = Flat-spectrum source;
 TD  = Transition Disk class;
 PTD = Pre-Transition Disk class.
 Table6 has the numbers of objects in my catalog for which my classes match
 (or do not match) the classes obtained from this other approach.
Note (6): For the most embedded sources, there is no provision in our scheme for
     identifying Class 0, and I do not use points at wavelengths longer than
     24{mu}m to determine classes. I would expect, though, that those objects
     that others have identified as Class 0 would work out to be Class I in my
     scheme. Please refer to Section 5 in the paper for additional details.

Global notes:
Note (G1): IAU standards recommend not renaming previously identified sources,
     but as one of the purposes of the present catalog is to sort out
     inconsistencies and inaccuracies in existing catalogs, assigning a new,
     coordinate-based name seems appropriate. The coordinate-based names
     presented here (in Tables 2 and 3) should be preceded by "R15-NGC 1333."
